# 🔧 Welcome to Daniel's Data Garage

**Data Scientist** | **Bionengineering Background**

*"It’s not just about the speed... it’s about the data behind it."* 

Where raw data gets a full tune-up, and models are built for speed and precision.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

After completing my degree in Bioengineering, I realized I was more drawn to the power of data than the lab. 🚀
I dove into data science, building models, deploying APIs, and solving real-world problems with code under the hood.
One of my proudest builds was a machine learning solution paired with a FastAPI interface — fast, accessible, and ready for action. 🏎️

## 🚀 Favorite Datat Science Memes
Here are some of my favorite data science memes that perfectly capture the joys and challenges of the field:

      <strong>Unmasking Machine Learning</strong><br>
      A classic twist where Machine Learning is revealed to be just Statistics in disguise.<br><br>

      <strong>Perception vs. Reality</strong><br>
      What people think data science is: 90% machine learning. Reality: 90% data cleaning.<br><br>

      <strong>The Weekend Effect</strong><br>
      Leaving code on Friday: "I'll finish this on Monday." Monday: "What does this mean?"<br><br>
